#Building a program that swaps the values of two variables
#To make the concept interesting I replaced the variable in context to asking users their strength and weakness. 

a = input('Enter your strength: ')
b = input('Enter value of weakness: ')

print("Before Swapping:")
print("strength =", a)
print("weakness =", b)

a,b=b,a

print("After Swapping:")
print("strength =", a)
print("weakness =", b)

#The input later converts the weakness to strength and strength to weakness
#The user can further dwell into their own understandings for self-reflection
